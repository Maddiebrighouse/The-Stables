        This site is an art piece which will document the journey which we will

          Note: <br /> 17 April
          <br /> We have already noticed a major fact about documenting this
          journey through COVID-19, that it is easy to document the good times.
          But its much harder to photograph the diffucult times. the moments
          when we are all down or doing nothing but hiding in our rooms all day
          is much hard to capture.
